**HTML element** is composed of HTML elements that encapsulate the content within opening and closing **tags**. 

## Syntax
Most HTML elements are written by **start tag** `<>` and **end tag** `</>`. For example, a **header** can be represented as:
```html
<h1> This is header </h1>
```

There are three types of elements: **normal**, **raw text**, **void**.
- **Normal elements**: start tag with number of HTML attributes, its content and end tag.
- **Raw text elements**: start tag with number of HTML attributes, its content contains raw text (not tag/element), end tag.
- **Void elements**: *only have* start tag with attributes.
