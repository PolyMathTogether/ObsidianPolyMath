## Overview
A PID Controller is a common closed feedback loop using integration and differentiation, PID standing for  Proportional integral derivative controller.
## Usage
## Goal
Our overall goal is for our error value/function, $e(t)$ to be 0.
## Calculation
First, we need to figure out how a PID controller works, it works by interpolating values, $e(t)$ using the three main parts, proportional, integral, derivative. 
### Proportional:
Multiply $e(t)$ by some $k_p$.
### Integral:
Multiply $e(t)$ by some $k_I$ then integrate. 
### Derivative:
Multiply $e(t)$ by some $k_D$ then differentiate.
### Sum all PID
