**Shaders** are **programs** that defines how to process the position datas as input of graphics pipeline to something that can be shown on screen. For example, [[Vertex Shader]] convert position datas from NDC (normalized device coordinates) to SSC (screen-space coordinates). Then [[Fragment Shader]] will take the result as input of it and color it. Basically, shaders will tell OpenGL how to draw pixels from your data to screen.
