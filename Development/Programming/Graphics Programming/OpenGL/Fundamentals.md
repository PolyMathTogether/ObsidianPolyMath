**GL** in **OpenGL** stands for **"graphic library"** so that means it will only concern about rendering into a **framebuffer**. In generally, it doesnt support any **input handler** or **window creation**. That is why i introduced **SDL** framework in [[Prerequisites]]. But you can also use other **windowing libraries** such as win32, glfw, SFML to learn OpenGL. It will mostly work the same.
