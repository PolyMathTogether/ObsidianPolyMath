### Calculus
# Introduction
This course will be based towards those who have basic Alegbra 2 knowledge, including polynomials mainly. 
If you know summation you can skip over the summation part of this course. 
# Review on Algebra 1-2
## Function Review
We normally define real single variate ( having only one variable ) functions as some $f(x)$, How to use functions,
### Function Example
![Untitled-2024-04-10-0835](https://github.com/PolyMathTogether/ObsidianPolyMath/assets/93007463/5ce0d0a8-9054-4709-ad74-a3145c7572b0)
## Average Rate of Change
### What does rate of change mean? 
In a linear standpoint we can think of the rate of change as some slope, some $y$ over some $x$ values. 
### Average Rate of Change Intuition and Derivation 
We can think about average rate of change most simply by imagining a line connecting some $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are our intervals, the rate of change is the slope of that line. To get an equation for that we want to define some $y$ over $x$, whereas $y$ is our $f(b)-f(a)$ and our $x$ is some $b-a$, in all we get this.
#### Formula
$$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$
## Sequences review
### Sequences Introduction
You can think of a sequence as a pattern with elements. 
#### Sequence Example: 
$$1+2+3+4+5\dots{10}$$ 

In this sequence the pattern is adding one to the past element.
# Summations
## Intro to Summations
Summations are a way of adding things up, maybe if you recall from Algebra 1, sequences, summations are a type of sequences.
## Notation of Summations
$$\sum_{i=c }^{n}x_i=x_{c}+x_{c+1}+x_{c+2}...+x_{n}$$
$i$ is the index, $c$ is the indedx start, $n$ is the index end
### Summation Example
Like before we can represent some sequences as summations, in our sequences example we can rewrite that as a summation
$$\sum_{i=1}^{10}i=1+2+3+4+5\dots{10}$$
$i=1$ means that the index starts at $1$, and the n value is $10$ which means it stops at $10$
# Limits

# Derivatives
## What are Derivatives?
Derivatives are known as the instantaneous rate of change. But what does that mean? 
### Intuitive Approach
Say we have some curve $f(x)$ now if we want to plot $$x^{3}-6x^{2}+10x-1$$
