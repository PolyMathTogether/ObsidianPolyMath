**The extended complex plane** is the **set of complex numbers** $\mathbb{C}$ with **the point at infinity**. It is denoted by $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$, $\overline{\mathbb{C}}$ or $\mathbb{C}_{{\infty}}$:
$$
\hat{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C} \cup \{\overset{\sim}{\infty}
\}
$$
Where $\overset{\sim}{\infty}$ is **complex infinity**. 

The extended complex plane can be also represented by **Riemann Sphere**.
