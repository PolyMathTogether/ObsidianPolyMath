## Definitions

Points $z_n$ such that $\frac{1}{f(z_n)}=0$
## Example

$$\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{\log(1+x^2)}{4+x^2}dx$$
We can find poles from both numerator and denominator. We can define this integrand by some $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, to find poles for the denominator we simply just find some values of x such that $g(x)=0$, 
In this case we want to solve for our equation on the bottom of the fraction, $4+x^2$, we can solve via some algebra $x^2=-4$ and both $2i$ and $-2i$ work.
