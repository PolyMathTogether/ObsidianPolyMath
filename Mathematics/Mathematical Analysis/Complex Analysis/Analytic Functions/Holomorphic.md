A function $f: C \to C$ is said to be _complex differentiable_ at $z \in C$ if:
$$
f'(z) = \lim_{ z \to z_{0} } \frac{f(z)-f(z_{0})}{z-z_{0}}
$$
exists. And if $f(z)$ is complex differentiable at every point $z \in U \subset C$ then $f(z)$ is said to be _holomorphic_ on $U$.

>Holomorphic functions are [[Analytic]] and vice versa

## Definition
$u\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ open.    $f:u\to\mathbb{C}$ is homomorphic if $f$ is complex differentiable at every $z_0\in{u}$.

If $u=\mathbb{C}$, the holomorphic function is called entire.
