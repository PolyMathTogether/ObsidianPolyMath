# Derivatives
## Brief Overview
The derivative is knownn as the instantaneous rate of change, it is one of the fundamental parts of Calculus and comes up in many applications, including statistics, physics and more. 
## Equations
### Formal definition
$$f^\prime\left(a\right)=\lim\limits_{h\to{0}} \frac{f\left(a+h\right)-f\left(a\right)}{h}$$
## Intuition
We  can think of this an extension of the average rate of change formula from finite to infinitesimal. 
## Proof / Derivation
