# Riemann sums
## Basic overview
Riemann sums are a method of approximation of integrals and describe the formal limit definition of an integral. 
## Equations
$$\int\limits_a^b f(x)dx=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum^n_{i=0}f\left(a+\frac{b-a}{n}i\right)\frac{b-a}{n}$$
## Intuition
What isn't a good definition without a genius and intuitive concept behind it. The intuition behind the riemann sums are that it discribes a $n$ amount of rectangles, with length of $\frac{b-a}{n}$ and height of $f\left(\frac{b-a}{n}i\right)$ wheras $i$ is the rectangle you are on.
