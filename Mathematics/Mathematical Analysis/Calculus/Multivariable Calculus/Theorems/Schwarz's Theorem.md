Let $U \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ then **Schwarz's theorem** or **Clairaut's theorem** states that if a function $f \, : \, U \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ has [[Partial Derivative]]s at $i$-th variable $x_i$ and at $j$-th variable $x_{j}$, and **mixed partial derivatives** $f_{x_{i}x_{j}}$ and $f_{x_{j}x_{i}}$ in neighborhood $U$ of a point $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and if $f_{x_{i}x_{j}}$ and $f_{x_{j}x_{i}}$ are continuous at $\mathbf{p}$ then

$$
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_{i} \partial x_{j}} f(\mathbf{p}) =  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x_{j} \partial x_{i}} f(\mathbf{p})
$$
