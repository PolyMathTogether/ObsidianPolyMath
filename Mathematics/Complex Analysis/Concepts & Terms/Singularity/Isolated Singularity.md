# Definition
---
If complex function $f(z)$ is [[Holomorphic]] on $\mathcal{U} \setminus \{c\}$, c is known as *isolated singularity* of $f$. Where $\mathcal{U} \in \mathcal{C}$ is an [[Open Set]].

# Examples
---
- $0$ is isolated singularity/simple pole of function $\frac{1}{z}$
- Every $z = k \in Z$ is an isolated singularity of function $\frac{1}{\sin (\pi z)}$
