# Definition
---
An [[Analytic]] function $f: C \to C$ has a _singularity_ $c$ if it is not _analytic_ at that point $c$. (undefined, discontinuity, non-differentiable, ...) 
# Examples
---
- $|z|$ is not differentiable at $0$.
- $\frac{1}{z}$ is undefined at $0$.
- $\lfloor z \rfloor$ is not continuous at any $n \in \mathcal{Z}$.
