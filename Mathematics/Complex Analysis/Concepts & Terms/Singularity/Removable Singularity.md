Removable [[Singularity]] or "no negative powers" singularity is a point at which function is _undefined_, but it can be assigned in _such a way_ that the function becomes [[Analytic]].

So [[Residue]] of $f$ at removable singularity always equals _zero_.
$$Res(f, c) = 0$$

# Examples:
---
- $0$ is removable singularity of function $\frac{\sin(z)}{z}$.
- $\frac{z}{e^z - 1}$ with $z = 0$
