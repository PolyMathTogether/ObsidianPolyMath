We can define some complex number $z$ as some real and imaginary parts, say $z=x+yi$, whereas $x$ and $y$ are both real numbers. 
## Extending complex numbers to complex functions
If we wanted some $f(z)$ we would need to define what a complex function out output, the most simple of it is just to define some $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$
### Why are these multivariate and not single variate?
lets take an example, $z^2$ we know that $z=x+yi$ so we can notate it as, $(x+yi)(x+yi)$ which equals, $x^2-y^2+2xyi$
