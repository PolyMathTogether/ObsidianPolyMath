# How to multiply by using properities of the parabola. 
If you plot two points $(a,a^2)$ and $(b,b^2)$ on the each side of the standard parabola then connect those points, the length of the line between the points is $a\cdot{b}$
## Proof / Derivation 
Take two numbers, lets say x and y, use pythagorean theorem with length of $b-a$ and height of $b^2-a^2$, now using pythagorean theorem convert this into some $x^2+y^2=z^2$, let the length be $x$ and the height be $y$. We can construct $\left(b-a\right)^2+\left(b^2-a^2\right)^2=z^2$
