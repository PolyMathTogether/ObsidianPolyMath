## The Basics
---
### The Postulates
---
$\quad$Regular Galilean relativity causes a contradiction in causality. The primary postulate of Special Relativity comes in clutch.
[[Postulates of Special Relativity]]

### Time Dilation
---
$\quad$The first phenomenon we shall explore as a consequence of the second postulate of Special Relativity.
[[Time Dilation]]

### Length Contraction
---
$\quad$Space and time are intertwined. Let's see how fast-moving objects get shorter in varying frames of reference.
[[Length Contraction]]

### Simultaneity
---
$\quad$Two events that occur at the same point in time in one frame of reference may occur at different time in another frame of reference, depending on the displacement between the two events.

### Lorentz Transformation
---
$\quad$All three phenomena discussed prior are used together to form the general coordinate transformation.
