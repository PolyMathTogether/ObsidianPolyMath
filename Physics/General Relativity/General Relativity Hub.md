## The Basics
---
### Coordinates Transformations
---
The starting point. We begin by observing the transformation of trajectories between two frames of reference.

### The Equivalence Principle
---
The principle of equivalence. How uniform gravitational field is indistinguishable from an accelerating frame of reference.
