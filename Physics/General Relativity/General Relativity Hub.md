## The Basics
---
### Coordinates Transformations
---
The starting point. We begin by observing the transformation of trajectories between two frames of reference.
[[Coordinates Transformation]]

### The Equivalence Principle
---
The principle of equivalence. How uniform gravitational field is indistinguishable from an accelerating frame of reference.

### The Mathematics in General Relativity
---
In Special Relativity, we had the Minkowski Space: the 4D space we all know and love. There is a property of this space that can be used to explained it
